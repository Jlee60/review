Our review is a Jupyter notebook within a container which also contains the operating system and version of Python to run the codeboxes. "

    "**Benefits of Using Jupyter Notebooks:**\n",
    "- Run code and see results instantly, making experimentation easy.\n",

    "## Chapter 1: A Taste of Py\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "Python is introduced as a readable, expressive language. The chapter parallels programs with recipes and patterns: \n",
    "they use a limited vocabulary, rules (syntax), and step-by-step instructions. It demonstrates tiny but real programs, \n",
    "shows how to run Python (interpreter or file), and previews core data structures (lists, dictionaries) and basic I/O.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts (with explanations)\n",
    "- **Running Python** — Use the interactive interpreter for quick experiments and .py files for scripts.\n",
    "- **print() and basic I/O** — print() sends output to the console; input() reads text from the user.\n",
    "- **Lists (sequence)** — Ordered collections indexed from 0; great for grouping related values.\n",
    "- **Dictionaries (mapping)** — Key–value storage for fast lookup by meaningful keys (e.g., names).\n",
    "- **Indentation and blocks** — Python uses indentation (spaces) to define code blocks instead of braces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Mistakes (Beginners)\n",
    "- Mixing tabs and spaces for indentation.\n",
    "- Forgetting that list indices start at 0, not 1.\n",
    "- Treating dictionaries like sequences (e.g., expecting a fixed order without care).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Study Questions\n",
    "1. How is a program like a recipe? List two similarities.\n",
    "2. What are two ways to run Python code? When would you prefer each?\n",
    "3. Explain when you’d choose a dictionary instead of a list."

    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "Data are objects in Python. Values have types (e.g., int, float, str) and may be mutable or immutable. \n",

    "- **Mutability vs. immutability** — Lists and dicts are mutable; ints, floats, and strings are immutable.\n",
    "- **Variable binding** — A variable name refers to an object; assignment rebinds the name.\n",
    "- **Multiple assignment** — You can bind multiple names in one statement or unpack sequences.\n",
    "- **Shallow vs. deep copy** — Copying containers needs care to avoid aliasing shared nested objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Mistakes (Beginners)\n",
    "- Expecting x = y to copy values for containers (it just binds a second name).\n",
    "- Modifying a list via one name and being surprised another name sees the change.\n",
    "- Confusing mutating a container (in-place) with rebinding the variable name.\n",

    "2. Why can changing a list via one variable affect another variable?\n",

    "and iterating over iterable objects including range. Introduces the iterator concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts (with explanations)\n",
    "- **while loops** — Repeat while a condition stays true; update the condition to avoid infinite loops.\n",
    "- **for loops and iteration** — Iterate over items in a sequence or any iterable.\n",
    "- **break / continue / else** — break exits early, continue skips to next iteration, else runs if no break.\n",
    "- **range()** — Generate integer sequences for counting and indexing.\n",
    "- **Iterating dictionaries** — Loop through keys, values, or items.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Mistakes (Beginners)\n",
    "- Forgetting to update the while condition, causing infinite loops.\n",
    "- Mutating a list while iterating over it (copy or build a new list instead).\n",
    "- Using indices with for when direct iteration is clearer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Study Questions\n",
    "1. Write a loop that sums numbers from 1 to 100.\n",
    "2. When does the else clause on a loop execute?\n",
